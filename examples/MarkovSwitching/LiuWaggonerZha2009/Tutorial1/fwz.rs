% constant transition probabilities from a chain we call "nk"
%N.B: The chain name could be anything as long as it does not contain "_" (underscores)
% a valid transition probability name contains exactly 3 underscores
% N.B: In RISE, we declare only the off-diagonal elements of the transition matrix

% the remaining parameters switch depending on the specification of the model and so
% are included in the "specific" specifications.
