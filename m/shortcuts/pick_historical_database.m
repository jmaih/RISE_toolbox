% Syntax
% -------
% ::
%
%   histdb=pick_historical_database(m)
%
%   histdb=pick_historical_database(m,type)
%
%   histdb=pick_historical_database(m,type,hist_end_date)
%
% Inputs
% -------
%
% - **m** [rise|dsge] : model object
%
% - **type** [{'mean'}|'random'] : type of database. If 'mean', the
% database with expected values is returned. If 'random', a database is
% drawn randomly using the probabilitiy distribution at the end of history.
%
% - **hist_end_date** [char|{sample end date}] : desired date for the end
% of history
%
% Outputs
% --------
%
% - **histdb** [struct] : structure with the time series of the endogenous
% variables, the regime probabilities
%
% More About
% ------------
%
% - The database is always drawn from the updated data and not the smoothed
% ones.
%
% - if the number of regimes is 1, "type" and "hist_end_date" are
% superfluous.
%
% - if a database is picked at random, the regime probabilities are changed
% so as to inform the forecasting procedure later on about what regime the
% data belong to. For instance, suppose we have 3 regimes and that the
% second regime is picked based on the distribution [.5,.2,.3] at the
% desired (or default) end date of history. Once the regime is picked,
% those probabilities are modified to [0,1,0]. This information is useful
% for determining the distribution, the next regime is drawn from.
%
% - if the type of database chosen is the "mean", the probability
% distribution of the historical regimes remain unchanged. i.e. [.5,.2,.3]
% remains [.5,.2,.3]. The consequence is that the historical state is not
% known with certainty.
%
% - if the user adds a time series called "regime" to the database, the
% information on the distribution of the historical probabilities is
% irrelevant since the regime variables should inform the forecasting
% procedure about where the system is going in the future.
