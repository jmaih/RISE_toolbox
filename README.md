Rationality In Switching Environments (RISE) Toolbox
================
Welcome to RISE!!! For any issue, suggestion or bug
report, please send an email to [junior.maih AT gmail.com](junior.maih@gmail.com)

RISE is an object-oriented Matlab toolbox for solving and estimating nonlinear
Regime-Switching Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (RS-DSGE) models.

A new paper describing the problem and the solution approach in RISE
can be found [here](http://www.norges-bank.no/en/Published/Papers/Working-Papers/2015/12015/).
Other references in the field include various papers by Dan Waggoner and Tao Zha, which
can be found [here](http://www.tzha.net/articles).

In RISE, the switching process and can be endogenous. RISE uses perturbation to approximate the nonlinear Regime-Switching DSGE (RS-DSGE) model and solves it using efficient algorithms.

Constant-parameter DSGE models are a special case. RISE also includes the solution
and estimation of
* [Loose commitment](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8686985) (or optimal policy) models
* sticky information models (Deprecated)
* hybrid expectations models (Deprecated)
* [models in which agents have information about future events](http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/events/research/2010CenBankForecasting/Maih_paper.pdf)

Features of the toolbox
-----------------------------------

* Symbolic, automatic and numerical derivatives

* Time Series

* Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian estimation

* Derivative-free optimization algorithms

* Forecasting and conditional forecasting

* DSGE-VAR modeling

* Integrated SVAR modeling with short, long and mixed restrictions

* High Dimensional Model Representation and Monte Carlo Filtering

* Reporting	system

Installation
-----

1. Download the toolbox either as zip file or through github (recommended)
2. add the toolbox path to Matlab and run rise_startup();

Documentation
---------------------
* This publicly available version of RISE is largely work in progress and there
is a documentation (PDF, HTML, etc) but that too is work in progress.
* RISE is very intuitive as you will quickly realize when you run the examples in RISE_toolbox\examples\
* Should you want to report a bug, make a suggestion or need help, please send an email to [junior.maih AT gmail.com](junior.maih@gmail.com)
